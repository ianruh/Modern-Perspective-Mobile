# Modern Perspective

Idea: Facilitate the comparison between history and the modern era through pictures. Explore historical sites around you and create blended photos to emphasize how places have changed.

Future Dev:

- [ ] There is an issure with react-native-svg that prevents exporting of the svg as a dataURL. Once that is figured out, then the blended photos can be added to the library of all photos.
- [ ] Error handling and network request failures failing gracefully.
